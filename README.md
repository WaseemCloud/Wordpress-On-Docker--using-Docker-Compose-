In this tutorial, I will be demonstrating how to build two containers. One for Wordpress, and the second is mysql, as Wordpress needs to have a Database as a dependency. Instead of building these containers individually, we will be deploying them using Docker Compose. Docker Compose files are used to run several containers with all their necessary configurations at once. You can also, specify the docker network that you wish to run your containers in.

-------------------

-------------------
# 1) Creating Docker Compose file:
-------------------

- This file can be found in the repository "wordpress-services.yaml".

-------------------
# 2) Running the Docker Compose File:
-------------------

- let's deploy our docker compose file to run the containers:

      docker-compose -f  wordpress-services.yaml up


-------------------
# 3) Verify containers:
-------------------

- Verify that both container "Wordpress" and "MySQL" have been successfully deployed and running perfectly fine:

      docker ps

-------------------
# 4) Access Wordpress:
-------------------

- Access your running Webpress container through the following link:

      http://localhost:8080/

-------------------
# 5) Delete Containers:
-------------------

- To destroy the recent build, also use the docker compose file that you have:

      docker-compose -f  wordpress-services.yaml down
